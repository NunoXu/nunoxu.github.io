description: This is a 1v1 multiplayer game made for Global Game Jam 2016, together with Carlos Margarido, Lu√≠s Oliveira and Tiago Cardoso.<br>The theme of the jam was 'Rituals', so we thought of a satanic ritual game type, so the game is two prophets in small arenas sacrificing animals in the altar in order to summon spells to smite the other prophet.<br>Controls&#58; P1 - WASD + SPACE | P2 - Arrows + Numpad . (dot).<br>All the art assets were taken from free Unity Packages.
