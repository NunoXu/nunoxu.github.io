  <div>This is a 1v1 multiplayer game made for Global Game Jam 2016, together with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-margarido/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carlos Margarido</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luis-rodrigues-oliveira/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lu√≠s Oliveira</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiago-andr%C3%A9-da-silva-cardoso-17798812a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiago Cardoso</a>.</div>
  <div>The theme of the jam was 'Rituals', so we thought of a satanic ritual game type, so the game is two prophets in small arenas sacrificing animals in the altar in order to summon spells to smite the other prophet.</div>
  <div>Controls&#58; P1 - WASD + SPACE | P2 - Arrows + Numpad . (dot)</div><div>All the art assets were taken from free Unity Packages.</div>
